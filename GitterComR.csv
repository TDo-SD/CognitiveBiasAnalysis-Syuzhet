Unfortunately the groovy implemention ignores annotation as well, so there is no 'pretty' way to workaround it.

Very briefly I am using cucumber-guice for DI and needing to use my own `InjectorSource`. Looking at the docs it states:\n\n> Cucumber needs to know where to find the cucumber.runtime.java.guice.InjectorSource that it will use. You should create a properties file called cucumber-guice.properties and place it in the root of the classpath. The file should contain a single property key called guice.injector-source with a value equal to the fully qualified name of the cucumber.runtime.java.guice.InjectorSource. For example: guice.injector-source=com.company.YourInjectorSource\n\nWell looking at the code it's actually simply looking for an environment variable not loading the properties file. Am I missing something?\n\n```java\n    public static final String GUICE_INJECTOR_SOURCE_KEY = \guice.injector-source\;\n    private final Env env;\n\n    public InjectorSourceFactory(Env env) {\n        this.env = env;\n    }\n\n    public InjectorSource create() {\n        String injectorSourceClassName = env.get(GUICE_INJECTOR_SOURCE_KEY);\n        if (injectorSourceClassName == null) {\n            return createDefaultScenarioModuleInjectorSource();\n        } else {\n            return instantiateUserSpecifiedInjectorSource(injectorSourceClassName);\n        }\n    }\n```,Team Wide,Customer support,How-to,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.952, 'pos': 0.032, 'compound': 0.3182}"

Before you start micro-optimising every part of your Gruntfile, the first thing you should do is measure how long the build takes to run in its current form. Then, after each refactoring, analyse the build's performance to ensure you've not introduced a regression.\n\n> For example, we recently added the grunt-concurrent plug-in into our Grunt set-up; it sped up the processing of two sub tasks with RequireJS, but it actually increased the build time for our Sass tasks. This was because the two sub tasks within Sass were running at 0.8 and 0.2 seconds.\n\n> Running them side-by-side with the 0.5 second penalty of spinning up a second instance of Grunt increased the time to 1.3 seconds! This is because there is a cost to running two tasks in parallel: normally about 0.5 seconds, the time it takes to spin up another instance of Grunt.",Team Wide,Communication,Communication with Teammates,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.8268}"

I will go and study about dynamic trace layer and comeback again. Thank you.\n@ahmedshuhel right, it doesn't exist currently, just where I'd like things to go\nwill discuss the ideas with Rob too\nGreat Thanks.\nWondering if anybody could give me some help learning how to configure jspm for a jquery plugin I'm playing with\nThe plugin in question is Lightbox2. It's github repo is here: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2\nI'm using it to learn about jspm and jQuery plugins\nSo anyways, I've got the following in my package.json\n\n\jspm\: {\n    \dependencies\: {\n      ...\n      \lightbox2\: \github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1\\n    }\n  }\n\nThen this in my config.js\n\nSystem.config({\n  \github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1\: {\n    \main\: \js/lightbox\\n    \shim\: {\n      \format\: \global\\n      \deps\: [\n        \jquery\\n      ],\n      \exports\: \Lightbox\\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nFurther down, I have this\n\nSystem.config({\n  \map\: {\n    \lightbox2\: \github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1\\n...\n\nBut when I run jspm install, I keep getting this:\n\nwarn No main entry point detected for github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1.\n     Try adding an override, or set the package.json \main\: false if this is the intention.\n\nok   Installed lightbox2 as github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1 (2.7.1)\n\nhey, you need to specifiy the override on install not in the config\njspm install lightbox2=github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1 -o override.json\nwhere override.json contains the main, and shim as above\nif that works, feel free to send a PR to the registry\n(https://github.com/jspm/registry/)\nok\nI'll be back\nWell, the install ran without errors. Let me see if I can import it\nugh, when I ran jspm install for my project it still gave me the error\nyes, the override only works along with the install command\nah\nyou need to check it into the registry to have this included by default\nNo way to have a local registry?\nyes you can do that too\nI've gotten it working, so I'll go work on creating a PR for the registry.\nhttps://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/wiki/Development-Workflows#creating-a-private-registry\nthanks\nthat would be great\nworking on getting these docs better organized\nSo this jspm css black magic, could you point me to some docs on that?\nB/c if I can get that working before I do the PR then that'd be nice\nI see this tweet: https://twitter.com/kevinold/status/472373477216100353\nBut can't find any info on how to go about it\nalso, gitter just continues to amaze me\n@guybedford One thing that would be nice is the ability to bundle based on a glob. With Aurelia, much of the app (non-framework) code is dynamically imported by the templating engine. There\u2019s no way to trace source code and determine what those imports will be. So, the pattern we would like to have is to be able to just point the bundler at a folder and tell it to bundle everything in that folder, more or less. Glob is nicer, of course.\nI've got the css module installed, but not sure how to set up the override.json and how to do the import call (I've tried both import \lightbox2.css!\ and import \lightbox.css!\)\nIn both cases, I get a 404\noverride.json as it stands now:\n\n```json\n{\n  \main\: \js/lightbox\\n  \dependencies\: {\n    \css\: \0.1.0\\n  },\n  \shim\: {\n    \js/lightbox\: {\n      \format\: \global\\n      \deps\: [\n        \jquery\\n        \../css/lightbox.css!\\n      ],\n      \exports\: \Lightbox\\n    }\n}\n```\n\n",Team Wide,Communication,Communication with Teammates,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.92, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.9426}"

TheHolyWaffle,5626b3438b37297f06fed6c8,2015-10-20T21:33:55.250Z,rogermb,"Because of a few things, actually. First up, Socket's isConnected method doesn't actually tell you when a disconnect happens. Instead, reading from the InputStream will throw an IOException; whereas writing to the OutputStream will simply block indefinitely without doing anything. Next up, we need to resend that last command that (probably) wasn't actually sent. To do this, we need to reset that command's runtime values and re-insert it into the outgoing queue. Neither the queue nor the command were built to support this operation. Then, we need to deal with all the reference and IO-Stuff like making sure nothing references the old Streams anymore and make sure that these are closed properly and the threads are shut down. After that, we could say \ok, connection re-established, done\ but it's not that easy. You're now reconnected, but not logged in and not in the correct channel. So how do we make sure the users of this API can act on a reconnect while still continuing the previous operations? I'm currently leaning towards an event-driven system: Just let the user write a method that makes sure the query is in a usable state again so we can resume sending the old commands after calling that listener. But finally, maybe the biggest problem of them all: I just don't have the time to write a clean, presentable solution to the problem, as I'm studying Computer Science. I even got a whacky, buggy solution running locally, but it's just not up to the standards of this API yet.",Team Wide,Customer support,How-to,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.8605}"
